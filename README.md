# Memory Game ðŸ§ 

This is a classic memory game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal is to match all pairs of cards to win the game. It features a responsive design and simple, clean visuals.

### Project Structure

The project is organized into three files:

* `index.html`: The main HTML file that provides the structure of the game.
* `style.css`: The CSS file for styling the game, including the responsive layout and card-flipping animation.
* `script.js`: The JavaScript file that contains all the game logic, including shuffling cards, handling clicks, and checking for matches.

### Setup and Installation

To get the game running, follow these simple steps:

1.  **Clone or download the project files.**
2.  **Ensure all files (`index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`) are in the same folder.** You'll also need the asset folder (`Assest`) containing the background and card images.
3.  **Open `index.html` in your web browser.** You can do this by double-clicking the file. The game should load automatically.

No special server or build process is required.

### How to Play

1.  **Start the game:** The cards will be displayed face down when the game loads.
2.  **Flip a card:** Click on any card to flip it over and reveal the hidden emoji.
3.  **Find a match:** Click on a second card.
    * **If the emojis match**, the cards will stay face up.
    * **If they don't match**, they will automatically flip back over after a short delay.
4.  **Keep playing:** Continue flipping pairs until you have found all the matches.
5.  **Win the game:** Once all pairs are matched, the game will display a "You've Won!" message.
6.  **Shuffle and restart:** To play again, click the **"Shuffle"** button to reset the board with a new arrangement of cards.
